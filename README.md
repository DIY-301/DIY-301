## Cooperation Plan

**Our team consists of one of the best students in ASAC we are ambitious and full of energy, Our main goal is to deliver the best possible result in our project and I'm sure that we can make everything happen because this is how it works! and the best way to do it by utilizing our skills individually and as a team and as a team  leader of this team I'll get the best of myself because leadership is something sort of missing in my personality as a professional competency and each member of the team will get the better of themselves too!**

## Conflict Plan

**We all agreed to be cooperative and productive workers and when any issues or conflicts or any kind of dissagreement arises we will vote for any suggestions and the highest
votes solution would be applied and all of us will be happy about it and no further issues will happen in that specific thing.**
 
**The main goal of this course was to make us better with all aspects including our technical aspect and by any chance if I felt that one of the team members is trying to take 
over the others work I'll try to talk to him and convince him to take a step back and give the others the opportunity and by any chance and I'm sure that will not happen I'll
be reporting him for our lovely instructor and I know that all of us may differ in our skills base but that doesn't mean one person should contribute more than the others instead we can all make benifit of it and learn some new stuff and as I said if any individual doesn't comply after several tries to the resolution will be reported to the instructor.**

## Communication Plan

**Most of the time all of team members should be comfortable to communicate at day and maybe sometimes at night and we'll be using several tools to communicate:**

 - Slack
 - Phone
 - Zoom
 - Sometimes Remo

**We will take breaks regularly based the efforts made and work done by that time and by any chance I felt that we started to fall behind I think that we work harder and take less breaks and be more active even at late night.**

**Everyone should give his opinion and I'll make sure that is everyone is contributing by asking them regularly about their opinions.**

## Work Plan

**I'll be giving taks in a way that everyone has a chance to work on each side (The frontend and the backend) and it will be pretty balanced to give the opportunity for each team member to contribute and I will be using trello to help us achieve this.**

## Git Process


**Our repos that we made on organization page will there and each one of us will have the chance to access the repos from the organization that we made and for the workflow it will be like this:**

1. Start a new feature.
2. Finish up a feature.
3. Review a feature for any possible issues or confilcts.
4. Publish a feature.
5. Getting a published feature.
6. Release at the end.

**2 people at least will review the PR and the leader will merge to main and by each finished feature I'll merge that work and I'll report other team members and meet if possible to commit the merge**
